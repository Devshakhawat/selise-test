# Quiz Marking Sytem
This is a Quiz Marking System plugin.

## Installation
I have just added production code here. So just install the plugin and see the output. Thanks

## To Go Development to Production
1. You should have installed composer and node before performing development to production
2. I have added vendor file( If you want to generate delete it and run `composer install` at terminal )
3. Run `npm install` to install node dependency
4. Run `npm run build` to build production mode
5. RUn `npm start` to start development code watch

## Output
1. Place this shortcode `show_quiz` to get output
